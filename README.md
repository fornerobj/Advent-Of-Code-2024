# What is this repo?
These are my solutions for as many of the advent of code 2024 problems as I could get to. I'm using this year's challenges to learn the Go programming language. I plan to have a directory for each day and one main file per directory. This file will have one function which computes day 1, and another function which computes day 2. 

# Will I be using LLMs?
I will **not** be using any LLMs or other AI assisted tools to complete these challenges. I am not familiar with Go, so I may look up syntactic things from time to time, but otherwise I will be completing these challenges with only my own knowledge.
